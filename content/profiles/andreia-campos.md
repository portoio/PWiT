**Early years and where you came from?**

I was born in Porto. With a degree in Management from FEP, I started working in finance for Siemens, a German company. I moved to Beijing in 2008 to study Mandarin and start working in the fashion industry. After Inov Contact program in Mexico City, I moved back to Porto to work for Parfois as Marketing Manager where I stayed for 4 years.

**How were you introduced to the world of tech?**

I was involved in the setup of Parfois’ e-commerce strategy.

**Walk me through your work and what you are doing now.**

Start my day looking at metrics, then move to testing out new features.  Whenever I can I also like to help the curation team with editorials.

**What part of what you do, you love the most?**

All the networking I have to do. I love meeting exciting new people.

**How do you think that your background and knowledge impact the way you approach your work?**

With a business degree I feel more confident with some decisions I have to make – however I always think that a Tech background would help a lot more in my work. Fortunately I’ve hired the best people to complement the areas where I have less experience.

**What advice do you have for young women that want to get into tech and don’t know where to start?**

Just surround yourself of the best people you can and be confident about the decisions you make.

**Walk me through a day in your life.**

Work – gym (lunch time) whenever I can – work again and then cooking dinner (it relaxes me in the end of the day).

**What's the best advice you've ever received?**

Don’t waste your time with things that don’t add value to you and your team. Focus!

**What apps/software/tools can't you live without?**

Slack, Skype, Trello and Gmail.
